# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of thise analysis was to first create an RDS on Amazon web services and import dataframes into SQL using the RDS. Second was to perform an analysis to determine if there was any benefit of vine reviews versus non-vine reviews. The datasets are massive which made the importing to SQL take almost an hour to finish. But the analysis went smoothly.
